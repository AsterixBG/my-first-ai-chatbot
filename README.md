## How to Use the AI Chatbot

This AI-powered chatbot is designed to provide context-aware responses using **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**, **Ollama**, and **Qdrant**. Follow the steps below to run and interact with the agent.

### 1 Start the Required Services

Before running the chatbot, make sure you have the necessary services up and running:

- **Ollama** (local LLM model)  
  Start Ollama if it’s not running:  

```sh
ollama run mistral
```

- **Qdrant** (vector memory storage)

```sh
docker run -d --name qdrant -p 6333:6333 qdrant/qdrant
```

### 2 Run the Chatbot

Once the dependencies are running, navigate to the `src` folder and start the console application:

```sh
cd src
dotnet run
```

### 3 Interact with the AI Chatbot

Once running, the console will prompt you to enter a message:

```
AI Chatbot (with improved context) – Type 'exit' to quit.
Enter your question:
```

Simply type your message and press `Enter`. The chatbot will analyze previous conversations stored in **Qdrant** and generate a response using the **Mistral** model.

Example interaction:

```
Enter your question: What is the capital of France?
AI: The capital of France is Paris.
```

### 4 Exiting the Chatbot

To exit, simply type `exit`
